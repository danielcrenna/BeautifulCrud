# Beautiful CRUD

## Description

A lightweight, opinionated driver for client-driven query shaping of API data.

This library automates the backend support for filtering, sorting, paging, and projection of API data, by providing a translation
layer between downstream data providers like Entity Framework, and API facing query strings.

## Usage

Queries are supported in either ASP.NET Core Controllers or Minimal APIs.

## Design Philosophy

This project tries to follow the now-deprecated [Microsoft REST API Design Guidelines](/docs/Guidelines.md), wherever possible.
